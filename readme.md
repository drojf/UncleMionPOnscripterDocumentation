# Unclemion Onscripter Documentation Parsing

## Project status

I'm not working on this project anymore. You can see the current state of results in the "release" section, as well as a JSON version of the documentation if you wish to use the raw data.

The the actual "parsed documentation" part is completed, and is relatively is useful (for example, I'm using the function argument list to determine the number/type of arguments for a script parser). The "reformatting documentation" part isn't very useful, and is only a skeleton at the moment.

I've mirrored UncleMion's website so you can still access it here: [https://www.drojf.com/nscripter/NScripter_API_Reference.html](https://www.drojf.com/nscripter/NScripter_API_Reference.html)

I'll leave the project un-archived in case there are any questions about the project or the Onscripter documentation.

## Development Environment

- You may want to open the html file in firefox/chrome, then use the inspector or right click->inspect element to visually see which part of the page corresponds to which HTML
